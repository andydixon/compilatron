        <p>Coding is a passion &hearts;</p>
        <p>The <strong>Pornolizer</strong> is a PHP application which rewrites the content of a website to make it rude, 
          running since the year 2000, it has been developed from perl, Python, .net to it's second iteration of PHP. 
          The core of which is now available as an <a href="https://packagist.org/packages/andydixon/pornolize">opensource 
            composer package</a> for all to use.</p>
        <p>After rewriting the Pornolizer, I developed <strong>ResolvR</strong>, which is an <em>opensource adblocking DNS 
          resolver</em> which helps bypass the issues experienced with adblocking code found on an increasing number of 
          websites. The benefit also being that it can be used with smart devices such as TVs to help eliminate tracking 
          and adverts.</p>

        <p>My latest on-going project is <strong>LibreScan</strong>, which is a free vulnerability scanner for websites. 
          Enter your website address, follow the validation requirements, and a report gets generated after the site has 
          been scanned. Simple, but effective. Futher development will allow for <em>automated form-based authentication</em>, <em>scheduled scanning</em>, and much more!</p>
